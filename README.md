Environment Configuration

Before starting the project, you need to set up the environment variables for your local machine.

Create a new file named .env in the root directory of the project.

Add the following environment variables to the .env file:

MONGODB=mongodb://<YOUR_DATABASE_INFOS>

TOKEN=<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>

Note: Replace <YOUR_DATABASE_INFOS> with the actual values for your database.

Important: The TOKEN value should be set to your own secret key.

Save the .env file and restart the server to make sure the environment variables are properly set.
